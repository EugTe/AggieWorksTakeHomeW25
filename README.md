# Moo-sic

Built as a take home submission for AggieWorksW25 @ UC Davis with the purpose of being a simple CRUD app that stores daily favorited tracks assigned by users and compiles into a collage. 

Currently adding more features such as location based sharing and comments. 

Made with React, Javascript (NodeJS and ExpressJS), Vite, TailWindCSS and MongoDB.
